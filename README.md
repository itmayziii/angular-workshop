# angular-workshop
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

This repository is part of a workshop presented by [Tommy May](https://twitter.com/iTMayzIII).
The goal of the workshop is to teach Angular by building a real world application. Obviously the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/docs)
is fantastic and this workshop aims to supplement the documentation using real world examples.

## Getting Started
1. Install the Angular CLI (preferably globally) `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
2. Clone project `git clone git@github.com:itmayziii/angular-workshop.git`
3. Install dependencies `npm i`

## Workshop Flow.
There are 2 exercises located in the [projects directory](/projects) with the naming convention `exercise-v**-(begin|end|README)`.
* The instructions for each exercise is in `exercise-v**-README.md`.
* You should begin an exercise by making your updates in the `exercise-v**-begin` directory.
* The `exercise-v**-end` directory is meant to serve as an example solution to the exercise problem. Obviously your encouraged to
give the exercise a shot yourself before looking at a solution.

Each exercise directory is it's own standalone Angular project and you can start a dev environment for each one
by running `ng serve --project exercise-v00-begin` or `ng serve --project exercise-v01-begin`.
